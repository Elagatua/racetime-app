    <h2>Manage team access</h2>
    <p>
        Control teams that have special access to this category. Teams that you
        select here will be able to bypass certain restrictions on the category,
        e.g. being able to create multiple race rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need to add access for a team to be able to race in this
        category. Typically, you should only add access for teams involved in
        things like tourney admin, stream organization and so on.
